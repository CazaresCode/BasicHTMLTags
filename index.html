    <h3>3 Characteristics for a Solid Arco Tone</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Objective:</b> Identify the 3 characteristics for a solid arco tone and apply it to the double bass.
    </p>

    <p>There are 3 primary characteristics that affect your bass tone:
        <ul>
            <li>Speed</li>
            <li>Weight</li>
            <li>Placement</li>
        </ul>
        Each characteristics depends on each other. This is a rough guide to help you get started.  
    </p>

    <h4>Speed</h4>
    <p>The speed is the velocity of the bow. You can bow fast, slow, or something in between. 
        <br/>
        It is <b>BEST</b> to practice your slow speed first while gradually increasing the velocity after mastering a slow speed.</p>
