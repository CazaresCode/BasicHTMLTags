    <h3>3 Characteristics for a Solid Arco Tone</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Objective:</b> Identify the 3 characteristics for a solid arco tone and apply it to the double bass.
    </p>

    <p>There are 3 primary characteristics that affect your bass tone:
        <ul>
            <li>Speed</li>
            <li>Weight</li>
            <li>Placement</li>
        </ul>
   
        Each characteristics depends on each other. This is a rough guide to help you get started.
    </p>
       
    

    <h4>Speed</h4>

    <p>The speed is the velocity of the bow. You can bow fast, slow, or something in between. 
        <br/>
        It is <b>BEST</b> to practice your slow speed first while gradually increasing the velocity after mastering a slow speed.
    </p>

    <h4>Weight</h4>

    <p>The weight (also known as pressure) should be natural arm weight to begin with.
      
        <br/>

        You add more weight through your thumb (German) or index finger. (French)
    </p>

    <h4>Placement</h4>

    <p>The placement is the point of contact between the bow and string. There are two factors that determine placement:
        <ol>
            <li>The location of the bow hair touching the string.</li>
            <li>The "<i>lane</i>" the bow is traveling on.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The placement of the bow can dramatically affect your timbre and tone.</p>

    <h3>Applying it to the Double Bass</h3>

    <p>All 3 characteristics work with each other. A good rule of thumb to remember is "Slow bow, low bow".</p>
    <p>That addresses the speed and placement, but not the weight. The weight depends on your dynamic level and the bow placement on the string. 
        <ul>
            <li>To get louder, add more weight</li>
            <li>To get softer, reduce the weight</li>
            <li>The further away you are from the frog, the more weight you add by rasing your arm to gain leverage.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
